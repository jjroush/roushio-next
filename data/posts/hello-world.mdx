Hey, thanks for checking this page out. I am not going to talk too much about myself as you can find that [here](https://roush.io/about). What I am going to talk about is the type of content you can expect to come out of this blog. 

I plan to discuss cool things that I've learned and I am passionate about. The internet is a cool place that allows for exchanging of ideas. I've used the internet countless times, and on a daily basis for my development. I'm hoping through this blog I can help some other people out on their development journey's. So keep on the lookout for future posts.
