I recently learned . In the name of learning more about worker threads, I decided to node script wihch could leverage the benefit of threading.
The main reason we would use worker threads in Node.js is to:

1. Keep the event loop unblocked.
1. Make stuff faster through parallelization.

# Worker Threads at a Glance

At a glance, JavaScript is single-threaded, the end. Worker threads allow 



# Demo 

**Follow along by cloning [my repo on Github.](https://github.com/jjroush/worker-thread-hash-cracker)**

The demo scripts take in a hash and compares it to 1,000,000 6-digit passcodes. (000000 - 999999)

## Background 

For this Demo I needed a CPU-intensive task. I decided on creating a hash cracker. Hashing is a one-way crypto function. 
Boiled Down: Hashing is a foundational password storage practice. It means if an attacker gets a hold of a password DB, they'll get a list of hashes and NOT the passwords themselves.
Since hashing is one-way, a hash cracker will take a dictionary of passwords and hash each one; comparing the given hash to the computed one. While computing a single hash takes a small amount of CPU time, it adds up.

_Disclaimer: This is just a demo. It is not as effecitive as other tools out there and you should not crack _

## Single-Threaded Example
[/example-scripts/single-thread-crack.js](https://github.com/jjroush/worker-thread-hash-cracker/blob/master/example-scripts/single-thread-crack.js)
```

for (let i = 0; i < passwordArray.length; i++) {
    const hash = crypto.createHash('md5').update(passwordArray[i]).digest('hex');
    if (hash === hashInput) {
        match = passwordArray[i];
    }
} 
```
This is what I described in the background section written in code.

If you are running this locally. Run this command in the terminal:


`npm run single-thread-crack 992e63080ee1e47b99f42b8d64ede953`


Then, wait.

...

`Passcode matching hash: 5555555`

`Time taken to hash a million passcodes:: 20.871s`

After around 20 seconds on my new MBP, I saw the value `5555555` for the inputed hash. This took a while, but that's not the only problem.

Run the command again, but this time enter text into the terminal by line while the program is running. 
After waiting another ~20 seconds, you should see something like this: 

asdf
Node echo: asdf
asdf
Node echo: asdf
asdf
Node echo: asdf
fgh
Node echo: fgh

How come we didn't see this input until after all the hashing? The reason is javascript is single-threaded and the event loop was blocked. The async readline was blocked. If this was a HTTP server, it would be unresponsive. 

Luckily, there is a solution!

## Multi-Threaded Example

You may be thinking: "Didn't you say JavaScript is single threaded?". You'd be correct. Node.js found a solution by exposing an API called thread_workers. This API exposes a worker. Each worker gets its own Javascript engine instance housed within the single Node.js process. Go more in depth.

```
for (let i = 0; i < threads; i++) {
    promiseArray.push(
        new Promise((resolve, reject) => {            
            const worker = new Worker('./worker.js', {workerData: chunkedArray[i]});
            worker.on('message', resolve);
        })
    )
}
```

In the multithreaded script, we see that we will first create an array of promises containing an instance of a worker.

```
new Worker('./worker.js', {workerData: chunkedArray[i]});
```

# Benefits

As shown from the demo, we are able to use worker threads in Node to make cpu-intensive tasks non-blocking and speeding up by working in parallel.



# TL:DR;
