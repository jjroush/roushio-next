I didn't think people would be interested in doing Leetcode-esque problems for fun however 200k people have proven that wrong.

For myself I have been using Advent of Code as a way to learn rust. ðŸ¦€ Through these problems, I've had some fun making rudimentary visualizations in the terminal to help learn the code I write (or rather AI generates for me).

# The Problem

The well-explained problem can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4) but the TL:DR; just trying to solve a cross-word finding `XMAS` in any directions.

# The Code

```rust
fn solve_part1(input: &str) -> i32 {

    let multidimensional_array: Vec<Vec<char>> = input
        .lines()
        .map(|line| line.chars().collect())
        .collect();

    let terms = ["XMAS"];
    let search_len = terms[0].len();

    let directions = [
        ( 1,  0),  // Right
        ( 0,  1),  // Down
        ( 1,  1),  // Diagonal down-right
        ( 1, -1),  // Diagonal down-left
        (-1,  0),  // Left (backwards)
        ( 0, -1),  // Up (backwards)
        (-1, -1),  // Diagonal up-left (backwards)
        (-1,  1),  // Diagonal up-right (backwards)
    ];
    
    let mut christmas_count = 0;
    
    for i in 0..rows {
        for j in 0..cols {
            for &term in &terms {
                if multidimensional_array[i][j] == term.chars().next().unwrap() {
                    'search: for (di, dj) in directions.iter() {
                        let mut found = String::new();
                        for k in 0..search_len {
                            let ni = i as isize + di * k as isize;
                            let nj = j as isize + dj * k as isize;
                            if ni < 0 || ni >= rows as isize || nj < 0 || nj >= cols as isize {
                                continue 'search;
                            }
                            
                            found.push(multidimensional_array[ni as usize][nj as usize]);
                        }
                        if found == term {
                            println!("Found '{}' at: ({}, {}), direction: ({}, {}){}", term, i, j, di, dj, "\x1b[K");

                            christmas_count += 1;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    christmas_count
}

```

Pretty cool right. Well chatGPT wrote a lot of it. All I wrote was the unit test and prompt.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_part1_example() {
        let input = include_str!("../../input/day04-test.txt");
        assert_eq!(solve_part1(input), 18);
    }
}
```



# Visualizing the Results

So great the code works I have a Star for Advent of Code on to the next problem. That didn't sit right; I wanted to understand how this works. 

My two requirements for visualizing this cross-word search code was fun colors and maintaining clean terminal history.

## ASCII Escapes
```shell

const FORMAT_TEXT_RED: &str = "\x1b[31m";
const FORMAT_TEXT_GREEN: &str = "\x1b[38;5;22m";
const FORMAT_TEXT_GOLD: &str = "\x1b[38;5;214m";
const FORMAT_TEXT_YELLOW: &str = "\x1b[38;5;227m";
const RESET_TEXT_FORMAT: &str = "\x1b[0m";
const CLEAR_SC_BUFFER: &str = "\x1b[3J";
```

All the magic to have fun terminal visualization.

Here is a simplified example with node:

![](https://roush-image.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ascii-colors.gif)

```shell
const RESET_TEXT_FORMAT = "\u001B[0m";
const CLEAR_SC_BUFFER = "\u001B[3J";

function sleep(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

const text = "Testing ASCII in 255 colors!";

const colors = ["\u001B[31m", "\u001B[38;5;22m", "\u001B[38;5;214m", "\u001B[38;5;227m"];

(async () => {
    for (const color of colors) {
        console.log(color + text + RESET_TEXT_FORMAT);
        await sleep(759);
        console.log(CLEAR_SC_BUFFER);
    }
})();
```

The above was all I needed to have a cool terminal display for my Advent of Code project.

A quick cheat sheet for the ASCII escape sequences:

`\x1b[38;5;{COLOR_HERE}m` - THisis used to set the foreground color in the terminal with 255 colors to choose from.

 `\x1b[0m` - This resets the text formatting back to default.

`\x1b[3J` - This clears the scrollback buffer in the terminal.

# It's not much but it's honest work

ASCII terminal escapes are nothing fancy but great to use if looking for simple and colorful ways to enhance terminal output.
